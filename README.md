# Final Portfolio
This is the final portfolio that I will be publishing on my Github. 

I spent the last 72 hours with this on my computer without realizing I had not made a repo until this moment. 
I still have some minor tweaks to make to it, especially the wording but plan to knock that out today hopefully, and re-write this readme to look more professional.
